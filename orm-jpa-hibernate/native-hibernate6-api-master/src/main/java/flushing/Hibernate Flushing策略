刷新: 同步持久化状态(缓存数据)与底层数据库同步的过程
Flushing is the process of synchronizing the state of the persistence context with the underlying database.

TODO. FlushMode提供四种刷新策略
ALWAYS
 Flushes the Session before every query.
AUTO
 This is the default mode, and it flushes the Session only if necessary.
COMMIT
 The Session tries to delay the flush until the current Transaction is committed,
 although it might flush prematurely too.
MANUAL
 The Session flushing is delegated to the application,
 which must call Session.flush() explicitly in order to apply the persistence context changes.
