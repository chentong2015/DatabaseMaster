Liquibase maintains a table called DATABASECHANGELOG which contains the script steps(changeSets)
   which have been executed on the current database so far.

Liquibase Checksum 设计原理: 基于三个信息判断
   This checksum helps Liquibase detect differences between the changesets you want to deploy
   and the changesets that have already been run against the database.

Liquibase Changesets 追踪数据库库的更新
   Liquibase tracks which changesets have run against your target database
   by the "id/author/filepath" combination

   - Have a <rollback> element declared in every changeSet
   - Have preconditions declared in changeSets
   - Make sure to specify always a unique AUTHOR for your module
   - Increase the ID for every new changeSet added
   - Do not create multiple tables in the same changeSet
   - Avoid database specific changesets 变更应该支持跨数据库
   - Use the dbms precondition to mark the changeset as ran even for databases other than the targeted one
