Liquibase Changesets 追踪数据库库的更新
Liquibase tracks which changesets have run against your target database by the "id/author/filepath" combination

TODO. Liquibase Checksum 设计原理
https://www.liquibase.com/blog/what-affects-changeset-checksums
- This checksum helps Liquibase detect differences between the changesets you want to deploy
  and the changesets that have already been run against the database.
- Liquibase determines that a changeset has been modified by
  comparing the MD5 checksum for the changeset to the checksum stored in the DATABASECHANGELOG table.

TODO. Liquiqbase 最佳实践
1. Have a <rollback> element declared in every changeSet
2. Have preconditions declared in changeSets
3. Make sure to specify always a unique AUTHOR for your module
4. Increase the ID for every new changeSet added
5. Do not create multiple tables in the same changeSet
6. Avoid database specific changesets
7. Use the dbms precondition to mark the changeset as ran even for databases other than the targeted one
